/*
Generate a list of stars with star ids between 500 and 600 (but not including 
500 and 600) with columns "starname", "startemp", "planetname", and "planettemp".
The list should have all stars, with the unknown data filled out with NULL.
These values are, as usual, fictional. Calculate the temperature for a star with
((class+7)*intensity)*1000000, and a planet's temperature is calculated from the
star's temperature minus 50 times orbit distance.
